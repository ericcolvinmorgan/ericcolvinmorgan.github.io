Hello!  My name is Eric Morgan.  I'm a software developer and CPA.  I've worked as a development resource for multiple Big 4 accounting firms.  Iâ€™ve served in internal client facing roles doing everything from serving as a development lead of both on-shore and off-shore teams to performing the role of a product owner, and in external client facing roles recommending and implementing technology based solutions to address client pain points and improve engagement efficiency.

This site is intended to be a place for me to express my thoughts and opinions, and to document personal projects.
